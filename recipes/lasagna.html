        <h5>The lasagna when it's finished</h5>

        <p>This recipe was given to me by my grandmother. She was a great cook and the thing I loved most when she made was this lasagna.</p>
        <p>It takes about 30 minutes to prepare, and then 30 minutes of oven time to finish it off and you'll have a nice, beautifully layered lasagna for everyone to enjoy!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pint ricotta cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
