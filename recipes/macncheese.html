        <h5>Mac and Cheese straight out of the oven</h5>

        <p>This recipe was given to me by my grandmother. She was a great cook and the thing I loved most when she made was this lasagna.</p>
        <p>It takes about 30 minutes to prepare, and then 30 minutes of oven time to finish it off and you'll have a nice, beautifully layered lasagna for everyone to enjoy!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package macaroni</li>
            <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed Cheddar cheese soup</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 pound shredded Colby cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Place macaroni in a 2 quart casserole dish. Stir in cheese soup and milk until well combined. Sprinkle with shredded Colby.</li>
            <li>Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is brown and bubbly.</li>    
        </ol>
